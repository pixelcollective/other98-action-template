    <p>44 million people in the US are uninsured. 38 million more are under insured. 45,000 people die each year due to lack of health insurance. We are facing a crisis in our country.</p>
    <p>For-profit, private health insurance corporations are price gouging us and denying us care to the point of debt, bankruptcy, and death. We all deserve better as our human right.</p>
    <p>We demand a Medicare for All single payer system. Medicare for All expands Medicare to cover everyone and guarantees comprehensive health care--including vision, dental, hearing, and long-term care.</p>
    <p>We demand a Medicare for All single payer system to finally guarantee health care as a human right - not a privilege. The Medicare for All Act of 2019 in the House and Senate must become law.</p>
